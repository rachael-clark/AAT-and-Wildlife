# Tasks

This file contains tasks from Shaun Keegan (SPK) to Rachael Clark, and vice versa.<br>

When you have completed a task, edit the file and strike through my instruction ~~like this~~, using the ~. Put two before the text, and two after the text you wish to strike through. If you have any tasks for me, use the fame format that I have below and I will get on them.

Single host model:
1. ~~Include the exponential term for your one host model in the vector equations.~~
2. ~~Test the model to ensure that you get sensible outputs now that the exponential equation has been added.~~ Remember no negative populations, or populations that increase when there's no births, etc.. Email me if you have trouble at this stage.
3. ~~Move from using the beta notation to using the a, b, c notation~~. This is a bit less aestetically pleasing for a single host model, but will make things easier when setting parameter values for the multi host model. Again, test the model as above. 

Two host model:
1. ~~Create this as a new file.~~
2. ~~Use notation to define the host specifically, like Sh1, Sh2, being for Susceptible (host 1) and Susceptible (host 2) respectively.~~
3. ~~Very thorough when testing this model - the more you add in the more likely we are to see a small error creep up. Email me when you have this so that I can review it.~~
4. ~~Any tasks, e.g. review model, for me to do, include them here and I'll cross them off when complete.~~
